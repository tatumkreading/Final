    <h3>Why Calculate College?</h3>
    <p>The net price college calculator allows potential students to 
        determine an acurate amount college would <br> cost them. Scholarships are subtracted from 
        amount to ensure the closest possible amount. Also supplies, dorm, <br> and any extra cost are added to have full amount. 
    </p>
    <h3>BREAKING DOWN THE CALCULATIONS</h3>
    <p class="factors">Several factors go into the college calculator and it's based on how you answed the questions. These five questions are the <br> most important in determining
         the most acurate cost of college</p>

    <p class="question1">Question #1: Cost of one year of College?</p>
    <p>Having the cost of one year of college helps break down the cost for the amount of time you plan to attend.</p>

    <p class="question2">Question #2: How many years do you plan on attending</p>
    <p>Question #1 and Question #2 both depend on the other. Based on the area you plan to major in, different amount of time <br> is required 
        to study. Each and every year you study at the college the more it will cost.</p>

    <p class="question3">Question #3: How many in your household attend college</p>
    <p>Different scholarships will give money to families and students based on how many family members go to college. Most <br>colleges will give families money 
        if the family member attends the same college. Otherwise federal <br> scholarships will give money if any family member attends college. 
        On average 3,000 dollars is given for every <br>family member in college.</p>

    <p class="question4">Question #4: How many siblings do you have</p>
    <p>Based on the number of siblings you have, FASFA, which is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, will <br> give 1,200 
       dollars for every sibling you have. </p>

    <p class="question5">Question #5: Do you plan to apply for FASFA</p>
    <p>FASAF is a free student aid application that you can fill out to recieve finacial aid. On average, a student can <br> recieve 5,000 dollars for financial aid. </p>

    <p class="question6">Extra's</p>
    <p>On average college students will spend an extra 15,340 dollars. 11,140 dollars on renting a dorm, house, or apartment. <br>1,200 dollars on books and supplies needed for classes. And 3,000 on traveling and other expenses. </p>

    <p class="question7">THE EQUATION</p>
    <p> (n1*n2)-(n3*3,000)-(n4*1200)+(15340)-5000</p>
    <p class="now">(With FASFA)</p>
    <p>(n1*n2)-(n3*5000)-(n4*1200)+(15340)</p>
    <p class="now">(Without FASFA)</p>
